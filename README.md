# An experiment to understand when Go will cache tests

I was adding Go's build cache into a persistant cache for CI and a colleague realized we might get some false-positive tests for our black box integration tests because they don't "declare their dependencies" for the compiler, they run as network services, and we wanted  to understand how we could make our BB integration tests ensure they always get run and never get cached, due to it.

When reading `go help test` I saw that the tests will not cache if an environment variable used in the test has changed. So I wanted to understand how that happens, and what the scope of the cache was.

Notably, the caching will only happen in "package list mode" which I know means `./...`, but what about a manual list of packages?

My conclusion from the experiment and reading code:

- Go runs tests per package, and packages in parallel, so if any test in the package relies on an environment variable and it changes, it invalidates the cache for all tests in that package
- This does not extend to subpackages
- If a library uses an environment variable and it's called through the test it's caught
  - This is not surprising because Go hooks into the `os.Getenv` call and logs each variable there, but I wanted it positively confirmed
- A manual list of packages will also get cached
  - `./` is cached and so is any number of packages
- `go test` without arguments (no targeting) is never cached (implies current package)
- `go test <file> [file...]` will also never get cached

I made a script, [test.sh] which contains my 9 test scenarios.

Raw notes of my research and how I ended up here:

- Any test that relies on environment variables will only cache if the variables are the same, so we got to wondering whether we could use the DRONE_SHA (or whatever equivalent for the current HEAD), because then we would have a unique var and not have to worry.
    - I'll do an experiment for this and see if we could add something into test-kit to get this benefit, I will start by looking at how the tests are setup with [[test-kit]] to see that, and then I'll do a test repo (ðŸ‘‹) and try some approaches
    - https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24589 seems to show a bug around this, so maybe I can find the code for how it works thereâ€¦
        - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16398488 for a link to a commit for file based
        - https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/internal/testlog/log.go
        - basically, every time you look up env vars and open files thereâ€™s an overhead to log it, so thereâ€™s an extra if in those lookups to support testing, neat!
        - if you have TestMain then testing/internal/testdeps will be smart enough [to not set the logger multiple times.](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/a85b8810c49515c469d265c399febfa48442a983/src/testing/internal/testdeps/deps.go#L111)
        - Then we use the testlog file and write it to a special place for the go command, through a flag: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/665af869920432879629c1d64cf59f129942dcd6/src/cmd/go/internal/test/test.go#L1547
    - Okay, time check: I don't need to fully understand how it works right now, I do want to share this later, but I can research it further after I have proven the ideas.
        - Most likely, what will make sense is that it only checks if the variable is used __at all__, so it shouldn't matter which test? Because it seems it doesn't know which test used the variable (which makes sense, that's complicated).

          https://github.com/golang/go/blob/a85b8810c49515c469d265c399febfa48442a983/src/testing/internal/testdeps/deps.go#L91-L107 doesn't say anything of context.
        - Invalidates when:
            - New test in package: YES
                - implies: modified test in package
            - ENV Var changes then in package changes: YES
                - Even tests that don't use the variable: YES
            - Test in sub-package: NO
                - The other package is invalidated, so the cache is on the package level
            - External module used in sub-package without reading var: YES
                - The module uses the env var but it's not immediately visible
        - I want to make a single script that runs these scenarios so I can validate that it works as expected
          - [test.sh]
  - To determine if the test cache is valid it writes a Unixnano timestamp into `$GOCACHE/testexpire.txt` [source](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/665af869920432879629c1d64cf59f129942dcd6/src/cmd/go/internal/test/test.go#L844-L848)
      - How long will it let the test be valid for when that's true? Because that means that any result baked into the container/cache is only cached for that longâ€¦
          - They stay valid forever, [it only gets marked as invalid when the cache is cleaned](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/665af869920432879629c1d64cf59f129942dcd6/src/cmd/go/internal/clean/clean.go#L185-L214), which is an optimization made to avoid having to traverse all the cache files and figure out which ones are related to tests
  - The cache is then tried at some point through [tryCache](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/6c3b5a2798c83d583cb37dba9f39c47300d19f1f/src/cmd/go/internal/test/test.go#L1741-L1746)
      - validates that we're run in "package list mode"
      - uses a `buildID` to determine if it's the same file as it was before, [which is defined as](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/8798f9e7a4929bafb570da29d342104c8cb32f9b/src/cmd/go/internal/work/buildid.go#L26-L31):
          - ```go
            // Go packages and binaries are stamped with build IDs that record both
            // the action ID, which is a hash of the inputs to the action that produced
            // the packages or binary, and the content ID, which is a hash of the action
            // output, namely the archive or binary itself.
            ```
          - to see the hashes run `GODEBUG=gocachehash=1 go test ./...`, there are several `GODEBUG` related to caching and if you read the source you'll see that it's liberally logging when the variable is set. To see which variables exist and why run `go help cache`.
      - Overall, I don't care, all I really wanted to know was how it did the work, which is through the testlog package -> hash those, and because we assume we'll need the same in subsequent runs we can't cache unless it's the same.
          - Does that mean there's a potential edge-case where we used to call one env var and now start calling another one? No, because the file hash is different, so it would of course be invalidated. This is on top of the file content itself.
